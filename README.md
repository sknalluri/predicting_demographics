Are BLS job descriptions predictive of workforce demographics?

This project will use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Job Descriptions to predict how closely the characteristics and demographics of a workforce such as sex, race, age matches that of the overall population from which it is drawn, controlling for geography, income, education and other factors. 

Types of data available include numerical, categorical and text. For the text data, we will perform topic modeling to extract relevant themes across the job descriptions. We will then use supervised learning models with ground truth labels from the BLS Labor Force Statistics to try to predict the demographic composition of occupations based on their job descriptions.
